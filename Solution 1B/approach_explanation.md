# Document Intelligence System - Approach Explanation

## Overview
Our Document Intelligence System leverages modern NLP techniques to extract and prioritize document sections based on persona-specific requirements and job-to-be-done tasks. The system uses lightweight, CPU-optimized models to ensure efficient processing while maintaining high accuracy.

## Core Methodology

### 1. Document Processing Pipeline
- **PDF Extraction**: Uses PyMuPDF for robust text extraction from PDF documents
- **Section Identification**: Employs regex patterns and formatting analysis to identify logical document sections
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Maintains page-level and section-level organization for precise referencing

### 2. Semantic Understanding with Sentence Transformers
- **Model Choice**: Uses `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` - a compact 90MB model providing excellent semantic understanding
- **Persona-Job Embedding**: Creates unified embeddings combining persona characteristics and job requirements
- **Cross-Domain Generalization**: The model's training on diverse text enables adaptation to various domains (academic, business, educational)

### 3. Multi-Factor Relevance Scoring
Our ranking algorithm combines three key factors:
- **Semantic Similarity (60%)**: Cosine similarity between section content and persona-job embeddings
- **Keyword Matching (30%)**: Domain-specific concept extraction and matching
- **Content Quality (10%)**: Length-based scoring to prefer substantial content over snippets

### 4. Sub-Section Analysis
- **Granular Extraction**: Breaks down top-ranked sections into paragraph-level components
- **Intelligent Refinement**: Summarizes lengthy content while preserving key information
- **Relevance Preservation**: Maintains connection to original context through parent section tracking

## Technical Optimizations

### Performance Constraints
- **CPU-Only Processing**: All models optimized for CPU inference using quantization techniques
- **Memory Efficiency**: Batch processing and lazy loading minimize memory footprint
- **Speed Optimization**: Strategic caching and vectorized operations ensure sub-60 second processing

### Model Size Management
- **Lightweight Architecture**: Total model size ~400MB (well under 1GB limit)
- **Efficient Tokenization**: DistilBERT tokenizer for fast text preprocessing
- **No Internet Dependency**: All models pre-downloaded during Docker build

## Cross-Domain Adaptability

### Domain Recognition
The system automatically adapts to different domains through:
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies academic papers vs. financial reports vs. educational content
- **Concept Extraction**: Domain-specific keyword patterns for research, business, and educational contexts
- **Flexible Section Detection**: Adapts to various document structures and formatting styles

### Persona-Driven Prioritization
- **Role-Specific Focus**: Tailors section selection based on persona expertise (researcher vs. student vs. analyst)
- **Task Alignment**: Prioritizes content relevant to specific job requirements
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains document structure for proper citation and reference

## Quality Assurance

### Relevance Validation
- **Multi-Metric Evaluation**: Combines semantic similarity with keyword matching for robust ranking
- **Human-Interpretable Scores**: Importance rankings provide clear prioritization
- **Content Quality Control**: Filters out low-quality sections and duplicate content

### Output Structure
- **Standardized JSON**: Consistent output format across all document types and personas
- **Metadata Preservation**: Complete traceability with document names, page numbers, and timestamps
- **Hierarchical Results**: Both section-level and sub-section analysis for different granularity needs

This approach ensures high-quality, persona-driven document analysis that scales across domains while meeting strict performance and resource constraints.
